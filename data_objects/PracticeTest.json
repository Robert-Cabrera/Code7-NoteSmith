    {
      "id": "q1",
      "question_text": "Which type of memory is closest to the CPU?",
      "options": ["Main Memory", "Cache Memory", "Virtual Memory", "Hard Disk"],
      "correct_answer": "Cache Memory",
      "explanation": "Cache memory stores frequently accessed data and instructions to speed up CPU operations."
    },

      "id": "q2",
      "question_text": "Which of the following has the largest capacity?",
      "options": ["Cache", "Registers", "RAM", "Hard Disk"],
      "correct_answer": "Hard Disk",
      "explanation": "Hard disks store significantly more data than RAM or cache, but are much slower."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "question_text": "What is the main purpose of cache memory?",
      "options": [
        "To permanently store user data",
        "To increase CPU clock speed",
        "To provide high-speed data access to the CPU",
        "To expand main memory capacity"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "To provide high-speed data access to the CPU",
      "explanation": "Cache reduces the time needed to access frequently used data, improving performance."
    },

      "id": "q4",
      "question_text": "Which of the following correctly represents the memory hierarchy from fastest to slowest?",
      "options": [
        "Cache → RAM → Secondary Storage",
        "RAM → Cache → Secondary Storage",
        "Secondary Storage → RAM → Cache",
        "Registers → Cache → RAM → Secondary Storage"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Registers → Cache → RAM → Secondary Storage",
      "explanation": "The closer the memory is to the CPU, the faster and more expensive it is."
    },
    {
      "id": "q5",
      "question_text": "What characteristic makes SRAM faster than DRAM?",
      "options": [
        "SRAM uses magnetic storage",
        "SRAM does not require refreshing",
        "SRAM has higher density",
        "SRAM uses optical circuits"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "SRAM does not require refreshing",
      "explanation": "Unlike DRAM, SRAM retains data without refresh cycles, making it faster."
